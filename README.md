## Predicting Pathological Gambling 

This project aims to predict early signs of pathological gambling using natural language processing techniques, specifically Sequence models with an attention module.

### Task Description
The task is to process sequential pieces of evidence (social media posts) and detect early traces of pathological gambling, also known as compulsive or disordered gambling. The data consists of posts or comments from social media users, categorized into pathological and non-pathological gamblers. The posts should be processed in chronological order to identify early signs of the disorder.

### Data
The dataset is provided by eRisk 2021-2022 and consists of a collection of writings (posts or comments) from a set of social media users.
